# Contributing Guidelines / 贡献指南

Thank you for your interest in contributing! 🎉

## Scope / 范围

This list focuses on deformable / soft body simulation **for embodied AI**:

- Simulation environments and platforms with deformable object support
- Manipulation tasks involving deformable objects (cloth, rope, soft bodies)
- Sim-to-Real transfer for deformable manipulation
- Benchmarks and evaluation for deformable object tasks
- 3D asset generation for building simulation environments
- Learning and policy methods for deformable object manipulation
- Foundational simulation techniques (physics engines, numerical methods)

**Out of scope:** pure graphics/rendering, rigid-body-only work, tactile sensing (unless directly tied to deformable manipulation).

## How to Add a Paper / 如何添加论文

**Edit one file, run one command:**

1. Open `papers.yml`
2. Add your entry under the appropriate section:

```yaml
- title: "Your Paper Title"
  url: "https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx"
  venue: "ICRA"          # optional
  year: 2026             # optional
  tags: [paper, star]    # paper / tool / dataset / benchmark / star
  desc_en: "One-line English description."
  desc_zh: "一行中文描述。"
```

3. Run `python generate.py` (requires `pip install pyyaml`)
4. This auto-generates both `README.md` (EN) and `README.zh-CN.md` (CN)
5. Submit a Pull Request
